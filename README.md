Practice Repository

This repository contains implementations and experiments in Python, MATLAB, and related tools. It serves as a personal workspace for testing concepts, running small projects, and exploring different libraries and techniques.

Contents

Natural Language Processing (NLP) – tokenization, stopword removal, POS tagging, etc.

Machine Learning – regression, classification, perceptron learning, PCA, etc.

Data Analysis – working with Pandas, visualization using Matplotlib.

MATLAB Scripts – numerical methods, optimization, and plotting examples.

Utility Scripts – small programs for automation and practice.

Purpose

To experiment with different algorithms and libraries.

To provide reference implementations for future projects.

Requirements

Python 3.8+

Required libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk

MATLAB R2022a+ (for .m files)
