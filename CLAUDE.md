# Practise — Project Context for Claude

Personal practice repository for AI/ML, computational intelligence, and data science experiments. Owner: Shiven Garia. GitHub: https://github.com/Shiven0504/Practise

## Stack & Environment
- **Python 3.8+** — primary language
- **JavaScript (Node.js)** — secondary, used for from-scratch algorithm implementations
- **Dependencies:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `skfuzzy`, `deap`, `seaborn`
- **Platform:** Windows 11, Git bash shell
- **IDE:** Cursor (VSCode-based)

## File Map

### Active Python files
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `adaline.py` | ADALINE neural net (batch LMS) for AND / OR / XOR gates. Trains all 3 gates in a loop, plots MSE + weight history side by side (3 rows × 2 cols). Returns `(weights, mse_history, epoch_reached, weight_history)`. |
| `autocorrelator.py` | Hopfield associative memory. Stores 3 bipolar patterns (A1–A3), builds weight matrix via outer-product rule, recalls patterns synchronously and asynchronously with energy tracking and noisy-input testing. |
| `ac_controller.py` | **Active code:** Genetic Algorithm (DEAP) for Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) — ordered crossover, shuffle-index mutation, tournament selection. **Commented out (triple-quoted):** Fuzzy Logic AC controller using `skfuzzy` (TempError + Humidity → CompressorSpeed). |
| `fuzzysets.py` | **All code is triple-quoted / commented out.** Contains fuzzy set operations (union, intersection, complement, difference), fuzzy Cartesian product relation, max–min composition. |
| `pca.py` | **Active code:** ID3 decision tree from scratch on the classic weather/Play dataset. **Commented out:** PCA + LDA on Iris using sklearn. |
| `test.py` | Multi-section file. Active code: fuzzy temperature membership demo (cold/warm/hot, 0–40°C triangular MFs), MLP neural net (sklearn) for AND gate. Commented out: seaborn plots (heatmap, scatter), ICA signal separation. |
| `new.py` | Large multi-section file. Active code: BFS graph traversal, water-jug BFS problem, NLTK NLP (stopword removal, POS tagging, lemmatization, Naive Bayes text classification), linear regression (sklearn), KNN on Iris, pandas data analysis + seaborn plots, Python data structures demo. Commented-out sections: ICA, more data viz. |
| `tempCodeRunnerFile.py` | Auto-generated by VS Code Code Runner. Simplified Hopfield recall — treat as scratch/temp, not canonical. |

### Active JavaScript files
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `script.js` | `getEverySecond(arr, start=1)` — returns every second element of an array (filter by index parity). Runs on `nums` (1–100), prints result + **sum** and **average**. Exported via `module.exports` for Node. |
| `new.js` | Full PCA implementation from scratch in JS — no external libs. Uses power iteration for eigendecomposition, deflation for multiple components. Exports `{ pca }`. |

### Data files
| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `iris.csv` | Iris dataset (150 rows, 4 features + species label) |
| `data.csv` | Small CSV used for data analysis experiments |
| `input.txt` | Raw text fed into NLTK stopword removal |
| `output.txt` | Filtered text output from stopword removal |

### Notebooks
| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| `ieslab.ipynb` | IES lab experiments |
| `machine_learning.ipynb` | ML experiments |
| `new.ipynb` | General scratch notebook |

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- **Commented-out code** is kept inside triple-quoted strings (`"""...""""`) rather than deleted — this is intentional, treat it as archived reference code, not dead code to remove.
- **Plotting:** always `matplotlib`, `plt.tight_layout()` + `plt.show()` at the end. Multi-panel layouts use `plt.subplots()`.
- **Reproducibility:** `np.random.seed(42)` or `seed=42` passed explicitly throughout.
- **Commit style:** short imperative subject line, bullet-point body explaining what changed and why. Co-authored with Claude.
- **No test framework** — verification is done by printing predictions with `OK`/`WRONG` markers or comparing against known outputs inline.
- **`tempCodeRunnerFile.py`** is auto-generated noise from the Code Runner VS Code extension — ignore it.

## Topic Areas Covered
1. **Neural networks from scratch** — ADALINE (LMS/Widrow-Hoff), Hopfield associative memory, MLP via sklearn
2. **Computational intelligence** — Fuzzy logic (sets, relations, composition, membership functions, AC controller), Genetic Algorithms (TSP via DEAP)
3. **Classical ML** — PCA, LDA, KNN, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, ID3 decision tree
4. **NLP (NLTK)** — tokenization, stopword removal, POS tagging, lemmatization, text classification
5. **Dimensionality reduction** — PCA from scratch (JS), ICA (sklearn FastICA)
6. **Data analysis** — pandas, seaborn (heatmap, boxplot, scatter, histogram, pairplot)
7. **Algorithms** — BFS, water-jug problem, TSP
8. **JavaScript ML** — PCA from scratch with no dependencies

## Workflow Preferences
- Always commit after meaningful changes with a descriptive message
- Push to `origin/main` when asked
- Verify pushes by checking GitHub API (`api.github.com/repos/Shiven0504/Practise/commits`)
- Modifications should be incremental — add features, don't rewrite working code
